Description: 
    Provides tools to simulate and analyse datasets of social interactions 
    between individuals using hierarchical Bayesian models implemented in Stan. 
    Model fitting is performed via the 'rstan' package. Users can generate 
    realistic interaction data where individual phenotypes influence and respond 
    to those of their partners, with control over sampling design parameters such 
    as the number of individuals, partners, and repeated dyads. The simulation 
    framework allows flexible control over variation and correlation in mean trait 
    values, social responsiveness, and social impact, making it suitable for 
    research on interacting phenotypes and on direct and indirect genetic effects 
    ('DGEs' and 'IGEs'). The package also includes functions to fit and compare 
    alternative models of social effects, including impact–responsiveness, 
    variance–partitioning, and trait-based models, and to summarise model 
    performance in terms of bias and dispersion. For a more detailed description 
    of the available models and impact–responsiveness, see the accompanying 
    preprint Wijnhorst et al. (2025) <doi:10.32942/X2F65M>.
